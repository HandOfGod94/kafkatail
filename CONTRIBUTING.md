### What to know before hand?

* Go. Well it's a simple language
* Some bit of experience with `kafka` and it's working would be really helpful. I'm not pro myself :)
  
That's it !!

### What if I found a bug?

* Please use `github` issues, and choose `Bug Report` to report it.

It contains bunch of checklist which would help us recreating, debugging and fixing things faster.

### What if I want to add a new feature?

I have tried to keep the domain constrained but am always open to implement new features which would make life of user easier.
We can discuss over it, on `github` issues.  
Do use `Feature Request` to raise a new feature request.

### What if I want to contribute by making code changes ?

1. use TDD while development to the extent possible. For rest of the cases, at-least always add a unit test for any code change.
2. For commit messages: follow [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
3. While raising PR, make sure, all the tests passes.
